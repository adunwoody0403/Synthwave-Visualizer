# Synthwave Visualizer
This is a music visualizer I made in 2020 for an original synthwave song entitled Ahjah Nobru. The visualizer was made using Unreal Engine 4 and leverages unreal's Sound Visualization framework to gather audio data. Audio data is used in order to make certain custom materials respond dynamically to the song. There were additional custom post processing shaders used to create a retro CRT feel to enhance the synthwave aesthetic. Click [here](https://youtu.be/0oRiXRuIIfg) to see the final product.
